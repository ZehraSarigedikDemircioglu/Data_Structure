 /*Box Average
    There is a truck in which we have to keep some undecided number of different boxes with each box having some weight assigned to it.
    We can keep putting boxes in the truck until it gets full. The truck has a special feature in it.
    When it gets completely occupied it displays the message "FULL" which means that now you can't put any box in the truck.
    Among all the boxes you have to find the heaviest and the lightest box and find their average.
    It is stated that the truck will contain at least one box (in this case weight of the heaviest and the lightest box will be the same).
    Find the average value.
    Note:
    Display the average as an integer rounded off to the nearest integer value.
            A ceil() value means rounding up the decimal value to the nearest integer.
    Method/Function Description:
    In the provided code snippet, implement the provided boxAverage (...) method using the variables to print the average of the lightest and heaviest box kept in the truck. You can write your code in the space below the phrase "WRITE YOUR LOGIC HERE".
    There will be multiple test cases running so the Input and Output should match exactly as provided.
    The base Output variable result is set to a default value of -404 which can be modified. Additionally, you can add or remove these output variables.
    Input Format:
    The first line of the input contains an integer, denoting the weight of the box to be kept in the truck.
    And the input is taken until the string "FULL" is encountered.
    Sample Input:
            1  	    -- denotes the weight of the box
            2	    -- denotes the weight of the box
            28	    -- denotes the weight of the box
            8	    -- denotes the weight of the box
            34	    -- denotes the weight of the box
            5	    -- denotes the weight of the box
            6	    -- denotes the weight of the box
            FULL	-- denotes the string
